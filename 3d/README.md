# 3D Printing Case

Please find the STL file for printing the case.
The original project is hosted on OnShape and accessible via this [link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/57cf3ac100a7df695029e298/w/8071d1b9ffe831e105a828e7/e/94084472d73540d8294d81d9).

Unfortunately, the sender case was crated with Autodesk Fusion 360 and I lost access to my account.
